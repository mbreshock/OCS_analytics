use stringr to remove unneccessary info in responses
ex: change responses to just Student, Educator, Self-learner etc -> str_extract
ex: remove "interested in" from "interested in statistics etc" responses -> str_remove
case_when() also helpful (from dplyr)
see diet case study for help

look into making codebook
